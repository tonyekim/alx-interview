## UTF-8 VALIDATION
<strong>UTF-8 Validation</strong> is the process of determining whether a sequence of bytes represents a valid UTF-8 encoded character.
<br> UTF-8 is a popular encoding format used to represent Unicode characters in digital data.
<br> The validation process involves checking the byte sequence against a set of rules defined by the Unicode Standard.

<h2>The rules for UTF-8 validation are as follows:</h2>
<ol>
<li>If a byte starts with 0, it represents a single-byte character. The byte is the character itself.</li>

<li>If a byte starts with 110, it represents a two-byte character. The next byte should start with 10, and the two bytes together represent the character.</li>

<li>If a byte starts with 1110, it represents a three-byte character. The next two bytes should start with 10, and the three bytes together represent the character.</li>

<li>If a byte starts with 11110, it represents a four-byte character. The next three bytes should start with 10, and the four bytes together represent the character.</li>

<li>Any other byte sequence is invalid.</li>
</ol>
<br>
In UTF-8 encoding, the first byte of a character always starts with a certain pattern of bits that indicates how many bytes are used to represent the character.<em> Here is a summary of the bit patterns for each byte in a UTF-8 character:</em>
<ol>
<li>For a single-byte character, the first bit is always 0.</li>
<li>For a two-byte character, the first two bits are always 110.</li>
<li>For a three-byte character, the first three bits are always 1110.</li>
<li>For a four-byte character, the first four bits are always 11110.</li>
</ol>
<br>For instance, to determine the bit pattern of a byte, you can convert the byte to binary notation and examine the first few bits. <br>Here is the binary notation for the byte sequences "41" and "C3 A9":
<ol>
<li>"41" in binary is 01000001. Since the first bit is 0, it is a single-byte character.</li>
<li>"C3 A9" in binary is 11000011 10101001. Since the first two bits of the first byte are 110, it is a two-byte character.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, to determine the bit pattern of a byte in a UTF-8 character, you can convert the byte to binary notation and examine the first few bits. This will tell you how many bytes are used to represent the character, which in turn allows you to determine the character code.</p>
